# Abstract
We present added features to the implementation of a snow simulation using a particle system and C++. The particle system was taken from lab assignment 2 section 4. By adding features such as particle size and weight, randomized spawn position, and transparency, we have been able to create a more realistic snow simulation. To perceive this simulation in 3D, we have also added key inputs to rotate the system. The user can also affect the number of particles released to control the density of the snowfall.
